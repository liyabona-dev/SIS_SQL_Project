# Student Information System (SIS) â€“ SQL Project

This project demonstrates a basic **Student Information System (SIS)** designed and implemented using **MySQL**. It includes a normalized database schema, sample data for 50 students, and SQL queries that showcase common data analysis and reporting tasks typically handled by a database administrator (DBA).

## ðŸ§  Database Design

The database consists of four normalized tables:

- `students`: Stores student information  
- `courses`: Stores course details  
- `enrollments`: Tracks which students are enrolled in which courses  
- `results`: Stores students' marks per enrollment and semester

Relationships are enforced using **foreign keys**.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- MySQL Server 8.x or higher
- MySQL Workbench or any SQL client (e.g., DBeaver, phpMyAdmin)

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Run `database_schema.sql` to create the database and tables.
2. Run `sample_data.sql` to populate the database with sample records.
3. Execute any of the query scripts to analyze and view the data.

## ðŸ“˜ Use Cases

This project is useful for:

- Practicing SQL and database administration tasks
- Demonstrating query writing and schema design
- Preparing for junior database administrator (DBA) roles
